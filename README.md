# decrypt-cm
A little tool for decrypting claymore's homegrown encryption that he uses in ethminer (and some other
miners.) I'm not exactly sure what this cipher is called, but it's pretty simple. Probably not intended as a super 
secure means of protecting stuff, but it keeps most of the lamers out.
